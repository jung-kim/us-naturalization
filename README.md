## Known Issues:

- There are 100 questions, but when I did janky auto parsed PDF I've picked up 90.  So 10 questions are missing
- Parsing was, bit challenging.  So random line break and spaces can be seen.
- "Answers will vary" can be seen throughout and could use a prompt to store user inputed data in to the local storage.
